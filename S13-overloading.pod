=head1 Overview

This synopsis discusses those portions of Apocalypse 12 that ought to have
been in Apocalypse 13.

=head1 Multiple dispatch

The overloading mechanism of Perl 5 has been superseded by Perl 6's
multiple dispatch mechanism.  Nearly all internal functions
are defined as C<multi> subs or C<multi> methods on generic types.
Built-in operators are merely oddly named functions with an alternate
call syntax.  All you have to do to overload them is to define your
own C<multi> subs and methods that operate on arguments with more
specific types.

For unary operators, this makes little effective difference, but for
binary operators, multiple dispatch fixes the Perl 5 problem of paying
attention only to the type of the left argument.  Since both argument
types are used in deciding which routine to call, there is no longer
any trickery involving swapping the arguments to use the right argument's
type instead of the left one.  And there's no longer any need to
examine a special flag to see if the arguments were reversed.

For much more about multiple dispatch, see S12.

=head1 Syntax

There is no longer any special C<use overload> syntax separate from the
declarations of the C<multi> routines themselves.  To overload an
existing built-in sub, say something like:

    multi sub uc (TurkishStr $s) {...}

A C<multi> is automatically exported if governed by a proto that is exported.
It may also be explicitly exported:

    multi sub uc (TurkishStr $s) is export {...}

Now if you call C<uc()> on any Turkish string, it will call your
function rather than the built-in one.

If you import a multi into a UNIT scope, it is automatically re-exported.

The types of the parameters are included in the I<longname> of any C<multi>
sub or method.  So if you want to overload string concatenation for Arabic
strings so you can handle various ligatures, you can say:

    multi sub infix:<~>(ArabicStr $s1, ArabicStr $s2) {...}
    multi sub infix:<~>(Str $s1, ArabicStr $s2) {...}
    multi sub infix:<~>(ArabicStr $s1, Str $s2) {...}

The C<use overload> syntax had one benefit over Perl 6's syntax in that
it was easy to alias several different operators to the same service
routine.  This can easily be handled with Perl 6's aliasing:

    multi sub unimpl (MyFoo $x, MyFoo $y) { upchuck(); }
    &infix:<+> ::= &unimpl;
    &infix:<-> ::= &unimpl;
    &infix:<*> ::= &unimpl;
    &infix:</> ::= &unimpl;

A C<multi> is in effect only within the scope in which it is defined or
imported.  Generally you want to put your C<multi> subs into a package
that will be imported wherever they are needed.

Conjectural: If the first parameter to a C<multi> signature is followed
by an invocant colon, that signature represents two signatures, one
for an ordinary method definition, and one for the corresponding C<multi>
definition that has a comma instead of the colon.  This form is legal
only where the standard method definition would be legal, and only
if any declared type of the first parameter is consistent with C<$?CLASS>.

=head1 Fallbacks

Dispatch is based on a routine's signature declaration without regard
to whether the routine is defined yet.  If an attempt is made to
dispatch to a declared but undefined routine, Perl will redispatch
to an C<AUTODEF> submethod [conjectural] as appropriate to define the routine.  This provides
a run-time mechanism for fallbacks.  By default, these declarations
are taken at face value and do not specify any underlying semantics.
As such, they're a "shallow" interpretation.

[Note: the following section on "is deep" may no longer be necessary given
the way metaoperators are now constructed.]

However, sometimes you want to specify a "deep" interpretation of
your operators.  That is, you're specifying the abstract operation,
which may be used by various shallow operators.  Any deep multi
declarations will be "amplified" into all the shallow operators that
can be logically based on it.  If you say:

    multi sub infix:<%> (Us $us, Them $them) is deep { mymod($us,$them) }

then

    multi sub infix:<%=> (Us $us, Them $them) { $us = $us % $them }

is also generated for you (unless you define it yourself).
The mappings of magical names to sub definitions is controlled by the
C<%?DEEPMAGIC> compiler hash.  Pragmas can influence the contents of
this hash over a lexical scope, so you could have different policies
on magical autogeneration.  The default mappings correspond to the
standard fallback mappings of Perl 5 overloading.

These deep mappings are mainly intended for infix operators that would have
difficulty naming all their variants.  Prefix operators tend to be simpler;
note in particular that

    multi prefix:<~> is deep {...}

is better written:

    method Stringy {...}

(see below).

=head1 Type Casting

A class may define methods that allow it to respond as if it were a
routine, array, or hash.  The long forms are as follows:

    method postcircumfix:<( )> (|capture) {...}
    method postcircumfix:<[ ]> (**@slice) {...}
    method postcircumfix:<{ }> (**@slice) {...}

Those are a bit unwieldy, so you may also use these short forms:

    method &.( |capture ) {...}
    method @.[ **@slice ] {...}
    method %.{ **@slice } {...}

The sigil-dot sequence in these short forms autogenerates the
corresponding public operators, in exactly the same way that
the sigil-dot in:

    has $.action;
    has @.sequence;
    has %.mapping;

autogenerates public accessor methods.

And because it uses the same method-autogeneration mechanism, the
specific sigil used to specify a short-form postcircumfix operator
doesn't actually matter...as long as it's followed by a dot and the
bracket pair containing the signature. (Though it's probably kinder
to future readers of your code to stick with the "natural" sigil
for each type of bracket.)

Note that the angle bracket subscripting form C<< .<a b c> >>
automatically translates itself into a call to C< .{'a','b','c'} >,
so defining methods for angles is basically useless.

The expected semantics of C<&.()> is that of a type 
on which may
or may not create a new object.  So if you say:

    $fido = Dog.new($spot)

it certainly creates a new C<Dog> object.  But if you say:

    $fido = Dog($spot)

it might call C<Dog.new>, or it might pull a C<Dog> with Spot's
identity from the dog cache, or it might do absolutely nothing if
C<$spot> already knows how to be a C<Dog>.  As a fallback, if no
method responds to a coercion request, the class will be asked to attempt to
do C<Dog.new($spot)> instead.

It is also possible (and often preferable) to specify coercions from
the other end, that is, for a class to specify how to coerce one of
its values to some other class.  So, if you define a method whose name
happens to be type name, you can view it as a coercion to that type. But that method
is a regular method even its name happens to be a type name. That means the
compiler does not enforce the type of the returned value.

    method Str { self.makestringval() }

As with all methods, you can also export the corresponding C<multi>:

    multi method Str is export { self.makestringval() }

in which case you can use both calling forms:

    $x.Str
    Str($x)

If the source class and the destination class both specify a
coercion routine, the ambiguity is settled by the ordinary rules
of dispatch.  That is, C<$x.Str> will always prefer the method form
and C<Str($x)> will always prefer the functional form.

Note that, because the name of an anonymous class is unknown, coercion to
an anonymous class can only be specified by the destination class:

    $someclass = generate_class();
    $someclass($x);
