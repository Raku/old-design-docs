=head1 Special Variables

=head2 Introduction

This document serves as a collection point
for what is known about special variables
in Perl 6 and correlates them with the changes from Perl 5.

If you are trying to find the Perl 6 equivalent of a Perl 5 special
variable you know, try searching this file for the Perl 5 version.
Each main entry is followed by a note containing the corresponding
Perl 5 variable(s). The list of main entries is also followed by
a table showing the 5 and 6 variables side-by-side.

=head2 Overview

=head3 Secondary Sigils (also known as "twigils")

A quick reminder of the relevant twigils from S02:

    $?foo   # Compiler constants (fixed at compile time)
    $*foo   # Context variable, default global (run time)
    $=foo   # File-scoped Pod data

The various C<$?foo> variables are determined at compile time, and are
not modifiable at run time.  This does not mean that the variable has the
same value everywhere; for instance, C<$?LINE> is different on every line
of the program.

The C<$*foo> variables function both as dynamically scoped variables
and as globals.  Globalness is relative, in other words.  Any dynamic
scope may modify the set of globals visible via the C<$*foo> notation.
Most of the standard globals listed below actually live either in
the C<PROCESS> or the C<GLOBAL> package, where C<PROCESS> contains
globals belonging to the entire process, while C<GLOBAL> contains the
globals belonging to the current interpreter, since a process may be
running more than one interpreter.  Unless otherwise indicated below,
the outermost definition of these variables are kept in the C<PROCESS>
package.

The C<$=foo> variables are related to the C<$?foo> variables
insofar as the text of the program is known at compile time, so the
values are static.  However, the different twigil indicates that the
variable contains Pod data, which is primarily under user control
rather than compiler control.  The structure of these variables will
be fleshed out in S26.

Note that dynamic variables such as C<$*OUT> may have more than
one current definition in the outer dynamic context, in which case
the innermost dynamic scope in which it is defined determines the meaning.  For instance,
C<$PROCESS::OUT> is the stdout for the entire process, but each
interpreter can set its own C<$GLOBAL::OUT> to make C<$*OUT> mean
whatever it wants independently of other interpreters.  Any dynamic
scope may also declare a local meaning of C<$*OUT> that applies only
to called code.  Likewise each thread could log its own errors
to its own C<$*ERR>, since a thread is a dynamic scope.

The class C<Application> collects a few common features of some of the special
variables such as C<$*PERL>, C<$?VM>, C<$*KERNEL>, etc.

 class Application {
     has Str $.name;
     has Str $.auth;
     has Version $.version;
 }

=head3 Perl5 to Perl6 special variable translation

If a column has a "-" in it, it means that item is unavailable in that version of Perl.

=head2 NOT YET DEFINED

The following items are not yet defined, but will need to be defined.

XXX Don't remove this line until this section is completely blank.

We also seem to have $*INC in the table at the top, @*INC in S19 and the table
immediately above, %*INC also in the table above.

The $?LANG and $*LANG variables are also confusing (both in S02).

=head3 Form.pm

These go in the Perl5 to Perl6 conversion table:

${^ENCODING} variable -- S32/Str.pod implies this is $?ENC
$?NF -- unicode normalisation form
${^UNICODE} variable

=head3 Infectious trait spec

${^TAINT} variable, which is pending, among other things, infectious trait spec

a general laundry list, please separate messages by topic.
