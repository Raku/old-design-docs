=head1 VERSION

    Created: 26 June 2013

    Last Modified: 30 June 2013
    Version: 3

This document tries to define many of the terms used in the Synopsis.  It does
not have an Apocalypse or Exegesis predecessor.  It is intended as both a
quick introduction to terms used on the #perl6 channel (on freenode), as well
as a more permanent, and deeper source of explanations in the context of Perl6.

If you, as a reader, miss a term in a glossary, just add the term with the
explanation.  Or if you are not sure what the missing term means, just add a
header for the term.  Without doubt, someone else more knowledgable will add
the explanation later for you and everybody else.

A generalized form of L</pair notation>.  They all start with the colon, like:

  adverbial pair  | pair notation

  :foo(bar)       | foo => bar
  :$foo           | foo => $foo
