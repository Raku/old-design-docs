=head1 TITLE

[DRAFT] Synopsis 31: Pragmatic Modules

=head1 VERSION

    Created: 24 Feb 2009

The document is a draft.

=head1 Overview

It is a general policy in PerlÂ 6 that any pragma designed to influence
the surface behavior of a keyword is identical to the keyword itself, unless
there is good reason to do otherwise.  On the other hand, pragmas designed
to influence deep semantics should not be named identically, though of
course some similarity is good.

All floating point IEEE modes must be lexically available via pragma except in cases
where that would entail heroic efforts to bypass a braindead platform.

XXX FIX: I (Tim Nelson) have no clue as to what the above entails, so the spec does not
reflect this XXX
