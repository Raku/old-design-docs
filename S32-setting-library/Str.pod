The document is a draft.

=head1 Str

General notes about strings:

The C<Str> class contains strings encoded at the NFG level. Other standard
Unicode normalizations can be found in their appropriately-named types: C<NFC>,
C<NFD>, C<NFKC>, and C<NFKD>. The C<Uni> type contains a string in a mixture of
normalizations (i.e. not normalized). S15 describes these in more detail.

The following are all provided by the C<Str> class, as well as related classes:

=over

=item chop

    multi method chop(Str $string: $n = 1 --> Str) is export

Returns string with an optional number of characters removed from the end.
Defaults to removing one character.

=item chomp

    multi method chomp(Str $string: --> Str) is export

Returns string with one newline removed from the end.  An arbitrary
terminator can be removed if the input filehandle has marked the
string for where the "newline" begins.  (Presumably this is stored
as a property of the string.)  Otherwise a standard newline is removed.

Note: Most users should just let their I/O handles autochomp instead.
(Autochomping is the default.)

=item lc

    multi method lc(Str $string: --> Str) is export

Returns the input string after forcing each character to its lowercase
form.  Note that one-to-one mapping is not in general guaranteed;
different forms may be chosen according to context.

=item uc

    multi method uc(Str $string: --> Str) is export

Returns the input string after forcing each character to its uppercase
(not titlecase) form.  Note that one-to-one mapping is not in general guaranteed;
different forms may be chosen according to context.

=item fc

    multi method fc(Str $string: --> Str) is export

Does a Unicode "fold case" operation suitable for doing caseless
string comparisons.  (In general, the returned string is unlikely to
be useful for any purpose other than comparison.)

=item tc

    multi method tc(Str $string: --> Str) is export

Converts the first character of a string to titlecase form,
leaving the rest of the characters unchanged, then returns the
modified string.  If there is no titlecase mapping for the first
character, the entire string is returned unchanged.  In any case,
this function never changes any character after the first.  (It
is like the old PerlÂ 5 C<ucfirst> function in that respect.)

=item tclc

    multi method tclc(Str $string: --> Str) is export

Forces the first character of a string to titlecase and the rest of
the characters to lowercase, then returns the modified string.

=item wordcase

    multi method wordcase(Str $string:
                          :&filter = &tclc,
                          :$where = True --> Str) is export

Performs a substitutional mapping of each word in the string,
defaulting to the C<tclc> mapping.  Words are defined as Perl 6
identifiers, hence admit hyphens and apostrophes when followed
by a letter.  (Note that trailing apostrophes don't matter when
casemapping.)  The following should have the same result:

    .wordcase;
    .subst(:g, / <ident>+ % <[ \- ' ]> /, *.Str.tclc)

The C<filter> function is always applied to the first and last word, and
additionally to any intermediate word that smartmatches with the C<where>
parameter. Assuming suitable definitions of word lists, standard English
capitalization might be handled with something like this:

    my $where = none map *.fc, @conjunctions, @prepositions;
    .wordcase(:$where);

(Note that the "standard" authorities disagree on the prepositions!)

[XXX: Is case-insensitive matching on C<wordcase>'s part necessary?]
The smartmatching is done case insensitively, so you should store
your exceptions in C<fc> form.  If the C<where> smartmatch does not
match, then the word will be forced to lowercase.

There is no provision for an alternate regex; if you need a custom
word recognizer, you can write your own C<.subst> as above.

=item samecase

    multi method samecase(Str $string: Str $pattern --> Str) is export

Has the effect of making the case of the string match the case pattern in
C<$pattern>.  (Used by s:ii/// internally, see L<S05>.)

=item samemark

    multi method samemark(Str $string: Str $pattern --> Str) is export

Has the effect of making the case of the string match the marking pattern in C<$pattern>.
(Used by s:mm/// internally, see L<S05>.)

=item length

This method does not exist in Perl 6. You must use either C<chars> or C<codes>,
depending on what kind of count you need.

=item chars

    multi method chars(Str $string: --> Int) is export

Returns the number of characters in the string. For C<Str> this corresponds to
the number of graphemes, for other types this is equivalent to C<codes>.

=item codes

    multi method codes(Str $string: --> Int) is export

Returns the number of codepoints in the string. For C<Str> this corresponds to
the number of characters as if it were an C<NFC> type string.

=item bytes

Gone. Use C<$str.encode($encoding).bytes> instead.

=item encode

    multi method encode($encoding = $?ENC --> Buf)

Returns a C<Blob> which represents the original string in the given
encoding. The actual return type is as specific as possible, so
C<$str.encode('UTF-8')> returns a C<utf8> object, C<$str.encode('ISO-8859-1')> a
C<blob8>.

C<Str.encode> is functionally equivalent to C<NFC.encode>. If you mean one of
the other normalization forms, convert the C<Str> to the appropriate type first.

=item index

    multi method index(Str $string: Str $substring, Int $pos) is export

C<index> searches for the first occurrence of C<$substring> in C<$string>,
starting at C<$pos>.

If the substring is found, then the value returned represents the position
of the first character of the substring. If the substring is not found,
C<Nil> is returned.  Do not evaluate it as a number, because that will
assume <0> and issue a warning.

[Note: if C<$substring> is not of the same string type as C<$string>, should
that cause an error, or should C<$substring> be converted to C<$string>'s type?]

=item pack

    multi pack(*@items where { all(@items) ~~ Pair } --> buf8)
    multi pack(Str $template, *@items --> buf8)

C<pack> takes a list of pairs and formats the values according to
the specification of the keys. Alternately, it takes a string
C<$template> and formats the rest of its arguments according to
the specifications in the template string. The result is a sequence
of bytes.

Templates are strings of the form:

    grammar Str::PackTemplate {
        regex TOP       { ^ <template> $ }
        regex template  { [ <group> | <specifier> <count>? ]* }
        token group     { \( <template> \) }
        token specifier { <[aAZbBhHcCsSiIlLnNvVqQjJfdFDpPuUwxX\@]> \!? }
        token count     { \*
                        | \[ [ \d+ | <specifier> ] \]
                        | \d+ }
    }

In the pairwise mode, each key must contain a single C<< <group> >> or
C<< <specifier> >>, and the values must be either scalar arguments or
arrays.

[ Note: Need more documentation and need to figure out what Perl 5 things
        no longer make sense. Does Perl 6 need any extra formatting
        features? -ajs ]

[I think pack formats should be human readable but compiled to an
internal form for efficiency.  I also think that compact classes
should be able to express their serialization in pack form if
asked for it with .packformat or some such.  -law]

=item rindex
X<rindex>

    multi method rindex(Str $string: Str $substring, Int $pos) is export

Returns the position of the last C<$substring> in C<$string>. If C<$pos>
is specified, then the search starts at that location in C<$string>, and
works backwards. See C<index> for more detail.

=item split
X<split>

    multi sub split(Str $delimiter,
                    Str $input,
                    Int $limit = Inf,
                    Bool :$all = False
                    --> List)
    multi sub split(Regex $delimiter,
                    Str $input,
                    Int $limit = Inf,
                    Bool :$all = False
                    --> List)
    multi method split(Str $input:
                       Str $delimiter,
                       Int $limit = Inf,
                       Bool :$all = False
                       --> List)
    multi method split(Str $input:
                       Regex $delimiter,
                       Int $limit = Inf,
                       Bool :$all = False
                       --> List)

Splits a string up into pieces based on delimiters found in the string.

Delimiters can be specified as either a C<Regex> or a constant string type. The
C<split> function no longer has a default delimiter nor a default invocant. In
general you should use C<words> to split on whitespace now, or C<comb> to break
into individual characters. (See below.)

If the C<:all> adverb is supplied to the string delimiter form, the delimiter
will be returned in alternation with the split values. In C<Regex> delimiter
form, the delimiters are returned as C<Match> objects in alternation with the
split values. Unlike with Perl 5, if the delimiter contains multiple captures
they are returned as submatches of single C<Match> object. (And since C<Match>
does C<Capture>, whether these C<Match> objects eventually flatten or not
depends on whether the expression is bound into a list or slice context.)

You may also split lists and filehandles. C<$*ARGS.split(/\n[\h*\n]+/)> splits
on paragraphs, for instance. Lists and filehandles are automatically fed through
C<cat> in order to pretend to be string. The resulting C<Cat> is lazy. Accessing
a filehandle as both a filehandle and as a C<Cat> is undefined.

=item comb

    multi sub comb(Str $matcher,
                   Str $input,
                   Int $limit = Inf,
                   Bool :$match
                   --> List)
    multi sub comb(Regex $matcher,
                   Str $input,
                   Int $limit = Inf,
                   Bool :$match
                   --> List)
    multi method comb(Str $input:
                      Str $matcher,
                      Int $limit = Inf,
                      Bool :$match
                      --> List)
    multi method comb(Str $input:
                      Regex $matcher = /./,
                      Int $limit = Inf,
                      Bool :$match
                      --> List)

The C<comb> function looks through a string for the interesting bits,
ignoring the parts that don't match.  In other words, it's a version
of split where you specify what you want, not what you don't want.

That means the same restrictions apply to the matcher rule as do to
split's delimiter rule.

By default it pulls out all individual characters.  Saying

    $string.comb(/pat/, $n)

is equivalent to

    map {.Str}, $string.match(rx:global:x(0..$n):c/pat/)

You may also comb lists and filehandles.  C<+$*IN.comb> counts the characters on
standard input, for instance.  C<comb(/./, $thing)> returns a list of single
character strings from anything that can give you a C<Str>.  Lists and
filehandles are automatically fed through C<cat> in order to pretend to be
string.  This C<Cat> is also lazy.

If the C<:match> adverb is applied, a list of C<Match> objects (one per match)
is returned instead of strings. This can be used to access capturing subrules
in the matcher. The unmatched portions are never returned -- if you want that,
use C<split(:all)>. If the function is combing a lazy structure, the return
values may also be lazy. (Strings are not lazy, however.)

=item lines

    multi method lines(Str $input: Int $limit = Inf --> List) is export

Returns a list of lines, i.e. the same as a call to C<$input.comb(/ ^^ \N* /,
$limit)> would.

=item words

    multi method words(Str $input: Int $limit = Inf --> List) is export

Returns a list of non-whitespace bits, i.e. the same as a call to
C<$input.comb(/ \S+ /, $limit)> would.

=item flip

The C<flip> function reverses a string character by character.

    multi method flip(Str $str: --> Str) is export

This method will misplace combining characters on non-C<Str> types.

=item sprintf

    multi method sprintf(Str $format: *@args --> Str) is export

This function is mostly identical to the C library sprintf function.

The C<$format> is scanned for C<%> characters. Any C<%> introduces a
format token. Format tokens have the following grammar:

    grammar Str::SprintfFormat {
        regex format_token { '%': ['%' | <index>? <precision>? <directive>] }
        token index { \d+ '$' }
        token precision { <flags>? <vector>? <precision_count> }
        token flags { <[ \x20 + 0 \# \- ]>+ }
        token precision_count { [ <[1..9]>\d* | '*' ]? [ '.' [ \d* | '*' ] ]? }
        token vector { '*'? v }
        token directive { <[csduoxefgXEGbpniDUOF]> }
    }

Directives guide the use (if any) of the arguments. When a directive
(other than C<%>) is used, it indicates how the next argument
passed is to be formatted into the string.

The directives are:

    %   a literal percent sign (must be literally '%%')
    c   a character with the given codepoint
    s   a string
    d   an integer, in decimal
    b   an integer, in binary
    o   an integer, in octal
    x   an integer, in hexadecimal
    X   like x, but using uppercase letters
    e   a floating-point number, in scientific notation
    f   a floating-point number, in fixed decimal notation
    g   a floating-point number, in %e or %f notation
    E   like e, but using an uppercase "E"
    G   like g, but with an uppercase "E" (if applicable)

Compatibility:

    i   a synonym for %d
    u   a synonym for %d
    D   a synonym for %d
    U   a synonym for %u
    O   a synonym for %o
    F   a synonym for %f

Perl 5 (non-)compatibility:

    n   produces a runtime exception
    p   produces a runtime exception

=item fmt

    multi method fmt(Scalar $scalar: Str $format = '%s' --> Str)
    multi method fmt(List $list:
                     Str $format = '%s',
                     Str $separator = ' '
                     --> Str)
    multi method fmt(Hash $hash:
                     Str $format = "%s\t%s",
                     Str $separator = "\n"
                     --> Str)
    multi method fmt(Pair $pair: Str $format = "%s\t%s" --> Str)

A set of wrappers around C<sprintf>. A call to the scalar version
C<$o.fmt($format)> returns the result of C<sprintf($format, $o)>. A call to the
list version C<@a.fmt($format, $sep)> returns the result of C<@a.map({
sprintf($format, $_) }).join($sep)>. A call to the hash version
C<%h.fmt($format, $sep)> returns the result of C<%h.pairs.map({ sprintf($format,
$_.key, $_.value) }).join($sep)>. A call to the pair version C<$p.fmt($format)>
returns the result of C<sprintf($format, $p.key, $p.value)>.

=item substr

    multi sub substr(Str $string, Int $start, Int $length? --> Str) is export
    multi sub substr(Str $string, &start,     Int $length? --> Str) is export
    multi sub substr(Str $string, Int $start, &end --> Str) is export
    multi sub substr(Str $string, &start,     &end --> Str) is export
    multi sub substr(Str $string, Range $start-end --> Str) is export

    multi method substr(Str $string: Int $start, Int $length? --> Str) is export
    multi method substr(Str $string: &start,     Int $length? --> Str) is export
    multi method substr(Str $string: Int $start, &end --> Str) is export
    multi method substr(Str $string: &start,     &end --> Str) is export
    multi method substr(Str $string: Range $start-end --> Str) is export

C<substr> returns a substring of C<$string> between the given points. The first
character can be specified as either an integer or a C<Callable> taking the
length of the string as its only argument. The endpoint can be specified by
either an C<Int> specifying the length of the substring, or a C<Callable> taking
the length of the string as its only argument and returning the last character
to take. The bounds of the substring can be specified by a C<Range> instead.

If the specified length or endpoint goes past the end of the string, or if no
endpoint is specified, the rest of the string from the starting point will be
returned.

Here is an example of its use:

    $initials = substr($first_name,0,1) ~ substr($last_name,0,1);

The function fails if the start position and/or length is negative or
undefined. (If the length argument is not given, it defaults to the rest of the
string.) Either of start position or end position may be specified relative to
the end of the string using a C<WhateverCode> whose argument will be the
position of the end of the string. While it is illegal for the start position to
be outside of the string, it is allowed for the final position to be off the end
of the string.

=item substr-rw

    multi sub substr-rw(Str $string, Int $start, Int $length? --> Str) is rw is export
    multi sub substr-rw(Str $string, &start,     Int $length? --> Str) is rw is export
    multi sub substr-rw(Str $string, Int $start, &end --> Str) is rw is export
    multi sub substr-rw(Str $string, &start,     &end --> Str) is rw is export
    multi sub substr-rw(Str $string, Range $start-end --> Str) is rw is export

    multi method substr-rw(Str $string: Int $start, Int $length? --> Str) is rw is export
    multi method substr-rw(Str $string: &start,     Int $length? --> Str) is rw is export
    multi method substr-rw(Str $string: Int $start, &end --> Str) is rw is export
    multi method substr-rw(Str $string: &start,     &end --> Str) is rw is export
    multi method substr-rw(Str $string: Range $start-end --> Str) is rw is export

A version of C<substr> that returns a writable reference to a part of a
string variable:

    my $string = "one of the characters in the Flinstones is: barney";
    $string ~~ /(barney)/;
    substr-rw($string, $0.from, $0.to) = "fred";

This writable reference can be the target of an alias, for repeated
operations:

    my $r := substr-rw($string, $0.from, $0.to);
    $r = "fred";   # "barney" replaced by "fred"
    $r = "wilma";  # "fred" replaced by "wilma"

Please note that only the start point is kept by the reference: any changes to
the length of the string before the start point, will render the reference
useless. So it is probably safest to keep only one writable reference per
string, or make sure that all replacement strings have the same size.

=item trim

    multi method trim() is export;
    multi method trim-leading() is export;
    multi method trim-trailing() is export;

The C<trim> method returns a copy of the string with leading and trailing
whitespace removed. The methods C<trim-leading> and C<trim-trailing> are
similar, but with only leading or trailing whitespace removed, respectively.

=item unpack

B<XXX To be defined>

=item match

    method match(Str $self: Regex $search, *%adverbs --> Match) is export

Returns the result of checking the given string against C<$search>. See S05 for
details.

=item subst

    method subst(Str $self: Regex $search, Str $replacement, *%adverbs --> Str) is export

Returns a string with the portion of the string matching C<$search> being
replaced with C<$replacement>. See S05 for details.

=item trans

    method trans(Str $self:
                 *@changes where { all(@changes) ~~ Pair },
                 *%adverbs
                 --> Str) is export;

Takes a list of C<Pair>s and replaces each occurence of a C<Pair>'s key with its
respective value. See S05 for details.

=item indent

    multi method indent($str: Int() $steps --> Str) is export
    multi method indent($str: Whatever $steps --> Str) is export

Returns a re-indented string wherein C<$steps> number of spaces have been added
to each line. If a line already begins with horizontal whitespace, the new
spaces are added to the end of those.

If the whitespace at the beginning of the line consists of only C<\x20>
spaces, C<\x20> spaces are added as indentation as well. If the whitespace
at the beginning of the line consists of some other kind of horizontal
whitespace, that kind of whitespace is added as indentation. If the whitespace
at the beginning of the line consists of two or more different kinds of
horizontal whitespace, again C<\x20> spaces are used.

If C<$steps> is negative, removes that many spaces instead. Should any line
contain too few leading spaces, only those are removed and a warning is issued.
At most one such warning is issued per C<.indent> call.

If C<$steps> is C<*>, removes just enough indentation to make some line have
zero indentation.

Empty lines don't participate in re-indenting at all. That is, a line with
0 characters will still have 0 characters after the call. It also will not
cause a warning to be issued.

The method will assume hard tabs to be equivalent to C<< ($?TABSTOP // 8) >>
spaces, and will treat any other horizontal whitespace character as equivalent
to one C<\x20> space. If the indenting doesn't "add up evenly", one hard tab
needs to be exploded into the equivalent number of spaces before the unindenting
of that line.

Decisions on how to indent each line are based solely on characters on
that line. Thus, an C<.indent> call on a multiline string therefore amounts
to C< .linesÂ».indent.join("\n") >, modulo exotic line endings in the
original string, and the proviso about empty lines.

=item IO

    method IO(--> IO::Path) is export

Returns an IO::Path, using the string as the file path.

=item path

    method path(--> IO::Path) is export

A deprecated form of C<IO>.

=item succ

    method succ(--> Str) is export

Increments the string to the next numeric or alphabetic value, and returns the
resulting string. The autoincrement operator C<++> uses C<succ> to determine
the new value.

The last portion of the string before the first period (which may be the entire
string) is incremented, using C<< <rangechar> >> to determine which characters
are eligible to be incremented. See L<S03/Autoincrement precedence> for
details.

=item pred

    method pred(--> Str) is export

Decrements the string to the next numeric or alphabetic value, and returns the
resulting string. The autodecrement operator C<--> uses C<pred> to determine the
new value.

When attempting to decrement a string, such as C<"a0">, where the result would
remove the leftmost characters, C<pred> returns failure instead.

The last portion of the string before the first period (which may be the entire
string) is incremented, using C<< <rangechar> >> to determine which characters
are eligible to be incremented. See L<S03/Autoincrement precedence> for details.
