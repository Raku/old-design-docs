=head2 IO

=over 4

=item getc

    our Bool method getc (IO $self: *@LIST)

See below for details.

=item print

    our Bool method print (IO $self: *@LIST)
    our Bool multi print (*@LIST)
    our Bool method print (Str $self: IO $io)

See below for details.

=item say

    our Bool method say (IO $self: *@LIST)
    our Bool multi say (*@LIST)
    our Bool method say (Str $self: IO $io)

See below for details.

=item printf

    our Bool method printf (IO $self: Str $fmt, *@LIST)
    our Bool multi printf (Str $fmt, *@LIST)

See below for details.

=item uri

    IO::Streamable method uri(Str $uri);

Returns an appropriate IO::Streamable descendant, with the type depending on the uri 
passed in.  Here's the mapping:

 URI type IO type
 ======== =======
 file:    IO::File or IO::Directory
 ftp:     IO::Socket::TCP (data channel)
 http:    IO::Socket::TCP

IO::Streamable method uri(Str $uri) {
	$uri.match(/^<alnum>+\:/);
	return(&$PROTOCOLS{$1}($uri));
}

=item %PROTOCOLS global variable

For each protocol, stores a subroutine reference that returns the appropriate object when 
the URI is passed in.  

=back

=head1 Roles

The functionality of IO objects is broken down into several roles,
which should identify the features each object supports.

=head2 IO

The base role only tags that this is an IO object for more generic
purposes. It doesn't specify any methods or attributes.

=head2 IO::Readable

This role provides unbuffered read access to the data stream.

role	IO::Readable {
	has	$.isReadable;

	method Int read($buf is rw, Int $bytes)
}

When the $.isReadable is set, it tries to change the readability of the filehandle.  This 
is not always possible, but can be done in a number of cases.  IO::Socket can remove 
readability by calling shutdown(), for example.  

=over

=item method Int read($buf is rw, Int $bytes)

Tries to read $bytes bytes and store in $buf. The contents of $buf
are replaced and the actual number of bytes read is returned. A return
of 0 means end of file. It might return unthrown failures, to be
specified by each IO implementation.

It is important to realize that this is "raw" read. You're going to
have plain octets stored in $buf, if this is actually encoded data,
you're going to need to encode it later, or use "getc" or other
IO::Readable::Encoded methods.

=back

=head2 IO::Writeable

This role provides unbuffered write access to the data stream.

role	IO::Writeable {
	has	$.isWriteable;

	method Int write($buf, Int $bytes)
}

When the $.isWriteable is set, it tries to change the writeability of the filehandle.  
This is not always possible, but can be done in a number of cases.  IO::Socket can remove 
writeability by calling shutdown(), for example.

=over

=item method Int write($buf, Int $bytes)

Tries to write $bytes bytes of $buf. The actual number of bytes
written is returned. It might return unthrown failures, to be
specified by each IO implementation.

It is important to realize that this is "raw" write. $buf should
contain plain octets that are going to be sent. If $buf contains
encoded data, you should decode it first, or use "print" or other
IO::Writeable::Encoded methods.

=back

=head2 IO::Seekable

=over

=item method Bool eoi()

EOI = End Of Input -- equivalent to End Of File, but applies to other kinds of sockets as 
well.  

Returns true if it's the end of the input (ie. end of file or whatever), returns false if 
not, returns undef if we can't say for certain.  

=item method Bool seek(Int $position)

Position this stream into $position. The meaning of this position is
always in "octets".

=item method Int tell()

Returns the current raw position in the stream in number of "octets".

=back

=head2 IO::Buffered

Indicates that this object performs buffering. The management of the
buffer is completely implementation specific.

=over 

=item method Bool flush()

Flushes the buffers associated with this object.

=item method Bool autoflush() is rw

Forces this object to keep its buffers empty

If set to nonzero, forces a flush right away and after every write
or print on the currently selected output channel.
Default is 0 (regardless of whether the channel is really buffered
by the system or not;
$OUT_FH.autoflush tells you only whether you've asked Perl
explicitly to flush after each write).
$*OUT will typically be line buffered if output is to the
terminal and block buffered otherwise.
Setting this variable is useful primarily when you are
outputting to a pipe or socket,
such as when you are running a Perl program under rsh
and want to see the output as it's happening.
This has no effect on input buffering.


=back

=head2 IO::Streamable

This role represents objects that depend on some external resource,
which means that data might not be available at request.

=over

=item new()

 method IO::Streamable new(
	Bool :$NoOpen,
 );

Unless the NoOpen option is passed, an open will be done on the IO object when it is 
created.  

=item method Bool blocking() is rw

This allows the user to control wether this object should do a
blocking wait or immediatly return in the case of not having data
available.

=item uri

 method IO::Streamable uri(Str $uri) {...}

This should be callable on the class, and act like a kind of "new()" function.  When given 
a URI, it returns an IO::Streamable of the appropriate type, and throws an error when an 
inappropriate type is passed in.  For example, calling IO::File.uri('http://....') will 
throw an error (but will suggest using just uri('http://...') instead).  

=back

=head2 IO::Encoded

This is a generic role for encoded data streams.

=over

=item method Str encoding() is rw

=item method Str locale() is rw

Encoding and locale are required for sane conversions.

=back

=head2 IO::Readable::Encoded

This role provides encoded access to a readable data stream, implies
IO::Encoded. Might imply IO::Buffered, but that's not a requirement.

=over

=item method Int input_record_count()

Returns a count of the number of records (lines?) that have been input.  
Now with cleaned-up localization usage.

=item method Str input_record_separator() is rw

This regulates how "readline" behaves.

The input record separator, newline by default.
This influences Perl's idea of what a ``line'' is.
Works like awk's RS variable, including treating empty lines
as a terminator if set to the null string.
(An empty line cannot contain any spaces or tabs.)
You may set it to a multi-character string to match a multi-character
terminator, or to undef to read through the end of file.
Setting it to "\n\n" means something slightly different
than setting to "", if the file contains consecutive empty lines.
Setting to "" will treat two or more consecutive empty lines
as a single empty line. Setting to "\n\n" will blindly assume
that the next input character belongs to the next paragraph,
even if it's a newline.

Remember: the value of input_record_separator is a string, not a regex.
awk has to be better for something. :-)

=item method Str input_field_separator() is rw

This regulates how "readfield" behaves.

=item method Str input_escape() is rw

This allows the definition of a escape character, which should be used
by readline and readfield.

=item method Str readline()

Reads the stream before it finds a $.input_record_separator and
returns it (including the separator). If $.input_escape is set, it
should pay attention to that.

=item method Str readfield()

Reads the stream before it finds a $.input_field_separator and returns
it (including the separator). If a readfield finds a
$.input_record_separator it consumes the record separator, but returns
undef. If $.input_escape is set, it should pay attention to that.

=item method Str getc(Int $char? = 1)

Reads the next $char character in the set $.encoding according to
the $.locale, or the undefined value at end of file, or if there was
an error (in the latter case C<$!> is set).

=back

=head2 IO::Writeable::Encoded

This role provides encoded access to a writeable data stream, implies
IO::Encoded. Might imply IO::Buffered, but that's not a requirement.

If these are called in their non-object form, they operate on C<$*OUT>, except in the 
case of warn(), which operates on C<$*ERR>.  The form with leading dot prints C<$_> to 
the appropriate handle unless C<$_> happens to be a filehandle.

=over

=item method Int output_record_count()

Returns a count of the number of records (lines?) that have been output.  

=item method Str output_record_separator() is rw

This regulates how say and print(%hash) behaves.

=item method Str output_field_separator() is rw

This regulates how print(@arr), say(@arr), print(%hash) and
say(%hash) behave.

=item method Str output_escape() is rw

This allows the definition of a escape character, which should be used
by say and print to preserve the record/field semantics.

=item method Bool print(Str $str)

=item method Bool say(Str $str)

Sends $str to the data stream doing proper encoding conversions. Say
sends an additional $.output_record_separator. This should also
convert "\n" to the desired $.output_record_separator.

=item method Bool print(Array @arr)

=item method Bool say(Array @arr)

Sends each element of @arr separated by $.output_field_separator. Say
should add an additional $.output_record_separator. If an element
contains the $.output_record_separator or the
$.output_field_seaparator and a $.output_escape is defined, it should
do the escaping.

=item method Bool print(Hash %hash)

=item method Bool say(Hash %hash)

Sends each pair of the hash separated by $.output_record_separator,
with key and value separated by $.output_field_separator. If one of
those contains a $.output_record_separator or a
$.output_field_seaparator and $.output_escape is set, it should do the
escaping.

=item our Bool method print (IO $self: *@LIST)

=item our Bool multi print (*@LIST)

=item our Bool method print (Str $self: IO $io)

Prints a string or a list of strings.  Returns Bool::True if
successful, Failure otherwise.  The IO handle, if supplied, must be
an object that supports I/O.  Indirect objects in Perl 6 must always
be followed by a colon, and any indirect object more complicated than
a variable should be put into parentheses.

It is a compiler error to use a bare C<print> without arguments.
(However, it's fine if you have an explicit argument list that evaluates to
the empty list at runtime.)

=item say our Bool method say (IO $self: *@LIST)

=item our Bool multi say (*@LIST)

=item our Bool method say (Str $self: IO $io)

This is identical to print() except that it auto-appends a newline after
the final argument.

    Was:    print "Hello, world!\n";
    Now:    say   "Hello, world!";

As with C<print>, it is a compiler error to use a bare C<say> without
arguments.

=item our Bool method printf (IO $self: Str $fmt, *@LIST)

=item our Bool multi printf (Str $fmt, *@LIST)

The function form works as in Perl 5 and always prints to $*OUT.
The method form uses IO handles, not formats, as objects.

=back

=head2 IO::Closeable

This role indicates that this object can be closed.

=over

=item method Bool close()

Closes the file or pipe associated with the object.

Returns True on success, but might return an unthrown failure.  
Returns true only if IO buffers are successfully flushed and closes the system
file descriptor.  

Unlike in Perl 5, an IO object is not a special symbol table entry
neither this object is available magically anywhere else. But as in
Perl 5, unless stated otherwise, IO::Closeable objects always close
themselves during destruction

=back

=head2 IO::Socket

role	IO::Socket {
	has %.options;
...
}

Accessing the %.options would on Unix be done with getsockopt/setsockopt.

=over

=item pair

    our List of IO method pair(Int $domain, Int $type, Int $protocol)

A wrapper for socketpair(2), returns a pair of IO objects representing the
reader and writer ends of the socket.

   use Socket;
   ($r, $w) = Socket.pair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, PF_UNSPEC);


=back

=head2 IO::Listening

=item open

 method open()

 Does a bind() and a listen().  

=item accept

 method IO::Socket accept()

=head2 IO::FileDescriptor

This role indicates that this object actually represents an open file
descriptor in the os level.

=over

=item method int fileno()

File descriptors are always native integers, conforming to C89.

=back

=head1 Classes

=head2	IO::File

This does file input and output.  

class	IO::File does IO::Streamable {
...
}

=over

=item new

 method new(
	FSNode :$FSNode, 
	Str :$Filename,
	:$fd
	Bool :$NoOpen, 
	:$Writeable,
	:$Readable
 );

The FSNode, Filename and fd options are mutually exclusive.  If "use portable" is in 
effect, the Filename option throws an error; use an FSNode instead.  

NoOpen is passed to IO::Streamable.new()

Examples:

 # Read -- throws errors with 'use portable'
 $fobj = new IO::File(Filename => $filename);

 # Write -- works with 'use portable'
 $fobj = new IO::File(
	FSNode => IO::FSNode.new(type => 'Unix', Filename => $filename), 
	Writeable => 1
 );

 # Read using file descriptor
 $fobj = new IO::File(fd => $fd);

This final example associates an IO object with an already-open file descriptor,
presumably passed in from the parent process.

=item open()

This function opens a file that had the "NoOpen" option passed to the new() method.  

=item IO.truncate

=item IO.fcntl

Available only as a handle method.

=back

=head2	IO::FileSystem

This represents the filesystem.  

class	IO::FileSystem does IO::Streamable does Tree {
	has	Str $.fstype; # ext3, ntfs, vfat, reiserfs, etc
	has	Str $.illegal_chars; # ie. /\x0
	has	Int $.max_path;
...
}

It inherits $cwn and $root from Tree.  

=over 4

=item glob

Returns FSNode objects

=item find

Returns FSNode objects

=item rename

=back

=head2	IO::FSNode

class	IO::FSNode does Tree::Node {
	has Array of IO::FSNodeACL @.ACLs;
	has Hash of %.times;
...
}

The %times has keys that can be eg. ctime, Modification, and Access (and maybe others on 
other operating systems), and the values are all Temporal::Instant objects.  

When .path() is implemented, it should return the path that this was opened with.  

=over 4

=item IO ~~ :X
X<:r>X<:w>X<:x>X<:o>X<:R>X<:W>X<:X>X<:O>X<:e>X<:z>X<:s>X<:f>X<:d>X<:l>X<:p>
X<:S>X<:b>X<:c>X<:t>X<:u>X<:g>X<:k>X<:T>X<:B>X<:M>X<:A>X<:C>

=item EXPR ~~ :X

  $file.:X
  $file ~~ :X

A file test, where X is one of the letters listed below.  This unary
operator takes one argument, either a filename or a filehandle, and
tests the associated file to see if something is true about it.

A Pair used as a pattern is treated as a file test.

    :r	File is readable by effective uid/gid.
    :w	File is writable by effective uid/gid.
    :x	File is executable by effective uid/gid.
    :o	File is owned by effective uid.

    :R	File is readable by real uid/gid.
    :W	File is writable by real uid/gid.
    :X	File is executable by real uid/gid.
    :O	File is owned by real uid.

    :e	File exists.
    :z	File has zero size (is empty).
    :s	File has nonzero size (returns size in bytes).

    :f	File is a plain file.
    :d	File is a directory.
    :l	File is a symbolic link.
    :p	File is a named pipe (FIFO), or Filehandle is a pipe.
    :S	File is a socket.
    :b	File is a block special file.
    :c	File is a character special file.
    :t	Filehandle is opened to a tty.

    :u	File has setuid bit set.
    :g	File has setgid bit set.
    :k	File has sticky bit set.

    :T	File is an ASCII text file (heuristic guess).
    :B	File is a "binary" file (opposite of :T).

    :M	Script start time minus file modification time, in days.
    :A	Same for access time.
    :C	Same for inode change time (Unix, may differ for other platforms)

The interpretation of the file permission operators C<:r>, C<:R>,
C<:w>, C<:W>, C<:x>, and C<:X> is by default based on:

=over

=item * The mode of the file and the uids and gids of the user

=item * ACLs (access control lists)

=item * read-only filesystems

=back

There may be other reasons you can't actually read, write, or execute 
the file.  Such reasons may be for example network filesystem access 
controls and unrecognized executable formats.  

Also note that, for the superuser on the local filesystems, the C<:r>,
C<:R>, C<:w>, and C<:W> tests always return 1, and C<:x> and C<:X> return 1
if any execute bit is set in the mode.  Scripts run by the superuser
may thus need to do a stat() to determine the actual mode of the file,
or temporarily set their effective uid to something else.

The C<:T> and C<:B> switches work as follows.  The first block or so of the
file is examined for odd characters such as strange control codes or
characters with the high bit set.  If too many strange characters (>30%)
are found, it's a C<:B> file; otherwise it's a C<:T> file.  Also, any file
containing null in the first block is considered a binary file.  If C<:T>
or C<:B> is used on a filehandle, the current IO buffer is examined
rather than the first block.  Both C<:T> and C<:B> return true on a null
file, or a file at EOF when testing a filehandle.  Because you have to
read a file to do the C<:T> test, on most occasions you want to use a C<:f>
against the file first, as in C<next unless $file ~~ :f  && $file ~~ :T >.

You can test multiple features using junctions:

  if -$filename ~~ :r & :w & :x  {...}

Or pass multiple tests together in OO style:

  if $filename.TEST(:e,:x) {...}


=item realpath

 method Str realpath();

Gets the real path to the object, resolving softlinks/shortcuts, etc

=item === operator

 method infix:<===>(Str $filename);

Test whether the specified filename is the same file as this file.  On a Unix system, 
this would presumably be done by comparing inode numbers or something.  

=item new

This is called automatically on object creation.  

multi method new(Array of Str :@PathElements);
multi method new(Str :$Type, Str :$Path, Str :$Create);
multi method new(Str :$Path);

This last throws an error if "use portable" pragma is used.  

If the "Create" option is passed in, and the node doesn't exist in the filesystem, it 
attempts to create the node; this can be used for "mkdir", "link", and similar 
functionality.  

Examples:

 $fsnode = new IO::FSNode(PathElements => ['home', 'wayland']);
 $fsnode = new IO::FSNode(Type => 'Unix', Path => '/home/wayland');
 $fsnode = new IO::FSNode(Path => '/home/wayland'); # portability error

=item delete

This deletes the FSNode from the filesystem.  If the node has children, it throws an error 
unless the "Recursive" option is specified.  Returns the number of nodes deleted.  

=back

=head2	IO::FSNodeACL

This is a basic abstraction; for better control, use the operating-system specific 
interfaces, over which this is a thin veneer.  

class	IO::FSNodeACL {
	has	Str $.type; # "User", "Group", "Everyone", ???
	has	Str $.id; # username or groupname; unused for $type eq "Everyone"
	has	%.permissions;
		# Unsupported values may (or may not) throw 
		# UnsupportedPermission when set or read
	has	IO::FSNode $.owningObject;
...
}

The permissions used in %permissions are:

=over

=item Readable

Should be supported by all filesystems as an item to read from the hash for the group 
"Everyone".  

=item Writeable

Should be supported by all filesystems as an item to read from the hash for the group 
"Everyone".  

=item Executeable

Supported on most Unix systems, anyway.  Windows should be able to guess when this is 
read, and throw an exception if written to.  

=item Default

An ACL of User,fred,Default sets the user "fred" to be the owner of the file.  This can be 
done with groups too.  Work on Unix, at least.  

=back

The $.owningObject attribute of FSNodeACL shows what the ACL is set on.  On a 
Windows system, this can be a parent directory, as permissions are inherited.  

=head2	IO::FileNode

 role	IO::FileNode does IO::FSNode {
...
 }

=over

=item our List multi method lines (IO $handle:) is export;

=item our List multi lines (Str $filename);

Returns all the lines of a file as a (lazy) List regardless of context.
See also C<slurp>.

=item our Item multi method slurp (IO $handle: *%opts) is export;

=item our Item multi slurp (Str $filename, *%opts);

Slurps the entire file into a Str or Buf regardless of context.
(See also C<lines>.)  Whether a Str or Buf is returned depends on
the options.

=back

=head2	IO::DirectoryNode

 role	IO::DirectoryNode does IO::FSNode {
...
 }

=item open

  $dir.open();

Opens a directory for processing, if the new() method was passed the NoOpen option.  
Makes the directory looks like
a list of autochomped lines, so just use ordinary IO operators after the open.

=item rmdir FILENAME
X<rmdir> X<rd> X<directory, remove>

=item rmdir

Deletes the directory specified by FILENAME if that directory is
empty.  If it succeeds it returns true, otherwise it returns false and
sets C<$!> (errno).  If FILENAME is omitted, uses C<$_>.

=head2 IO::LinkNode

 role	IO::LinkNode does IO::FSNode {
...
 }

=item link

=item readlink

=item symlink

=head2	IO::Socket::TCP

class	IO::Socket::TCP does IO::Socket does IO::Streamable {

=over

=item has $.RemoteHost

=item new

 method IO::Socket::TCP new(
	Str :$RemoteHost, Str :$RemotePort, 
	Str :$LocalHost, Str :$LocalPort, 
	Bool :$Blocking, 
	Bool :$NoOpen
 );

The NoOpen option is passed to IO::Streamable.new()

IPv6 is supported.  

=item open

 method open()

If it's not an IO::Listening, it does a connect().

It's intended for the case where the creation of the object didn't do one.  

=item method Int read($buf is rw, Int $bytes)

Does a recv().  

=item method Int write($buf, Int $bytes)

Does a send().

=item IO.getpeername

=item /[get|set][host|net|proto|serv|sock].*/

=back

=head2 IO::Pipe

class	IO::Pipe does IO::Streamable {
...
}

May also do IO::Readable and IO::Writable, depending on opening method.  

=over

=item close()

If the file handle came from a piped open, C<close> will additionally
return false if one of the other system calls involved fails, or if the
program exits with non-zero status.  (If the only problem was that the
program exited non-zero, C<$!> will be set to C<0>.)  Closing a pipe
also waits for the process executing on the pipe to complete, in case you
want to look at the output of the pipe afterwards, and
implicitly puts the exit status value of that command into C<$!>.

=item Pipe.to

    our IO method to(Str $command, *%opts)

Opens a one-way pipe writing to $command.  IO redirection for
stderr is specified with :err(IO) or :err<Str>.  Other IO redirection
is done with feed operators. XXX how to specify "2>&1"?

=item Pipe.from

    our IO method from(Str $command, *%opts)

Opens a one-way pipe reading from $command.  IO redirection for
stderr is specified with :err(IO) or :err<Str>.  Other IO redirection
is done with feed operators. XXX how to specify "2>&1"?

=item Pipe.pair

    our List of IO method pair()

A wrapper for pipe(2), returns a pair of IO objects representing the
reader and writer ends of the pipe.

   ($r, $w) = Pipe.pair;

=head1 OS-specific classes

=head2 Unix

=head2 IO::FSNode::Unix

=item chown

    our Int multi chown ($uid = -1, $gid = -1, *@files)

Changes the owner (and group) of a list of files.  The first
two elements of the list must be the numeric uid and gid, in
that order.  A value of -1 in either position is interpreted by
most systems to leave that value unchanged.  Returns the number
of files successfully changed.

    $count = chown $uid, $gid, ’foo’, ’bar’;
    chown $uid, $gid, @filenames;

On systems that support C<fchown>, you might pass file handles
among the files.  On systems that don’t support C<fchown>, passing
file handles produces a fatal error at run time.

Here’s an example that looks up nonnumeric uids in the passwd
file:

   $user = prompt "User: ";
   $pattern = prompt "Files: ";

   ($login,$pass,$uid,$gid) = getpwnam($user)
       or die "$user not in passwd file";

   @ary = glob($pattern);      # expand filenames
   chown $uid, $gid, @ary;

On most systems, you are not allowed to change the ownership of
the file unless you’re the superuser, although you should be
able to change the group to any of your secondary groups.  On
insecure systems, these restrictions may be relaxed, but this
is not a portable assumption.  On POSIX systems, you can detect
this condition this way:

    use POSIX qw(sysconf _PC_CHOWN_RESTRICTED);
    $can_chown_giveaway = not sysconf(_PC_CHOWN_RESTRICTED);

=item chmod LIST
X<chmod> X<permission> X<mode>

Changes the permissions of a list of files.  The first element of the
list must be the numerical mode, which should probably be an octal
number, and which definitely should I<not> be a string of octal digits:
C<0o644> is okay, C<0644> is not.  Returns the number of files
successfully changed.

    $cnt = chmod 0o755, 'foo', 'bar';
    chmod 0o755, @executables;
    $mode = '0644'; chmod $mode, 'foo';      # !!! sets mode to --w----r-T
    $mode = '0o644'; chmod $mode, 'foo';     # this is better
    $mode = 0o644;   chmod $mode, 'foo';     # this is best

=item lstat

Returns a stat buffer.  If the lstat succeeds, the stat buffer evaluates
to true, and additional file tests may be performed on the value.  If
the stat fails, all subsequent tests on the stat buffer also evaluate
to false.

=item stat

=item IO.stat

Returns a stat buffer.  If the lstat succeeds, the stat buffer evaluates
to true, and additional file tests may be performed on the value.  If
the stat fails, all subsequent tests on the stat buffer also evaluate
to false.

=head2 IO::POSIX

Indicates that this object can perform standard posix IO
operations. It implies IO::Readable and IO::Writeable.

=item IO.eof

Gone, see IO::Endable

=item IO.fileno

See IO::FileDescriptor

=item IO.name

Changed to .path(), but we haven't gotten around to specifying this on all of them.  

The C<.name> method returns the name of the file/socket/uri the handle
was opened with, if known.  Returns undef otherwise.  There is no
corresponding C<name()> function.

=item pipe

Gone, see Pipe.pair

=item select(both)

Gone.  (Note: for subsecond sleep, just use sleep with a fractional argument.)

=item IO.shutdown()

Gone, see IO::Socket.close(), $IO::Readable.isReadable, and $IO::Writeable.isWriteable

=item socketpair

Gone, see Socket.pair

=item IO.sysread

Gone, see IO::Readable.read()

=item IO.syswrite

Gone, see IO::Writeable.read()

=item utime

Gone, see %IO::FSNode.times.
